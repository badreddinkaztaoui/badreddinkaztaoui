Hi there, I'm Badreddin ðŸ‘‹
============================

I'm a creative frontend developer who is passionate about building beautiful and responsive user interfaces using React, Next.js, Three.js and GSAP. I enjoy working with these cutting-edge technologies to create visually stunning and intuitive web applications that enhance the user experience.

In addition to my frontend skills, I'm also a curious learner and interested in exploring the world of C and Unix systems. I'm currently a student at 42 Network, where I'm sharpening my coding skills and gaining hands-on experience with C programming and Unix systems.

### Landing pages.

A collection of responsive landing pages built using modern web development technologies. The pages are designed to be visually stunning and engaging, with a focus on delivering a seamless user experience.

The Landings project is a great resource for developers and designers looking to create high-quality landing pages quickly and efficiently. Each template is available as a standalone project, making it easy to incorporate into any existing website or web application. The project is open-source and contributions from the community are always welcome.

### Project 2

A retro-style web game builted using THREEjs, the game challenges players to navigate through a series of increasingly difficult levels while avoiding obstacles and collecting coins. (Still in DEV mode).
