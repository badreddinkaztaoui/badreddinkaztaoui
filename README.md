Hi there, I'm Badreddin ðŸ‘‹
============================

I'm a creative frontend developer who is passionate about building beautiful and responsive user interfaces using React, Next.js, Three.js and GSAP. I enjoy working with these cutting-edge technologies to create visually stunning and intuitive web applications that enhance the user experience.

In addition to my frontend skills, I'm also a curious learner and interested in exploring the world of C and Unix systems. I'm currently a student at 42 Network, where I'm sharpening my coding skills and gaining hands-on experience with C programming and Unix systems.
